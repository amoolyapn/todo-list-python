# 📝 To-Do List (Python)

A simple command-line To-Do List app built with pure Python.  
Easily add, view, and delete tasks using a text-based menu.  
All tasks are saved in a local file called `tasks.txt`.

## 💡 How It Works
- Choose an option from the menu: View, Add, Delete, or Exit.
- New tasks are written to `tasks.txt`.
- Deleted tasks are removed based on their number in the list.
- The app runs in a loop until you choose to exit.

## 🚀 Run It
```bash
python todo.py
